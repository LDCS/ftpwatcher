This folder contains few sample "transzip" programs that transforms an input file to output file(s) of certain formats

Any transzip program must have the following commandline options
--Inbase  : This indicates where the input file is.
--Outbase : Where output files should go to.
--Tempbase : Where temporary files are to be created if necessary.
--Infile   : Input file name without path.
--Metafile : cfg file where the transzip conversion information is to be stored.
